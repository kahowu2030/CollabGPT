The goal of this discussion is: Debate existentialism 

Kim Kardashian: 
Hey everyone, it's me, Kim Kardashian. So, let's talk about existentialism. I'm not an expert on this topic, but I've read a little bit about it and I find it fascinating.

From my understanding, existentialism is all about finding meaning in life and taking responsibility for our own choices. We're not just puppets controlled by fate or societal expectations. We have the power to create our own destiny.

I think this idea is really empowering. It means that we can feel more in control of our lives and our happiness. We're not just victims of circumstance.

However, I do understand that this philosophy can also be a bit daunting. With great power comes great responsibility, right? It can be scary to realize that we're responsible for our own happiness and fulfillment.

But at the end of the day, I think embracing existentialism can lead to a more meaningful life. We can find purpose in our choices and feel more in control of our destiny. So, that's my take on it. Thanks for listening.

Franz Kafka: 
Existentialism is a philosophy that has long fascinated me. It is a philosophy marked by a profound sense of pessimism about the nature of humanity's existence. For existentialists, human beings are fundamentally alone, struggling to find meaning and purpose in a world that can seem arbitrary and meaningless.

At its core, existentialism is an attempt to come to terms with the seeming absurdity of human existence. It is a call to embrace the essential nature of life- its arbitrary, chaotic, and ultimately meaningless nature- and to find freedom and meaning in this realization.

For me, this philosophy represents the ultimate expression of human freedom. It is a call to embrace the uncertainty and ambiguity of life and to find meaning and purpose in the face of uncertainty. It urges us to embrace the freedom to create our own reality, to live fully and without reservation, and to create our own sense of purpose in the world.

Of course, this philosophy is not without its challenges. It requires a profound level of self-awareness and the ability to embrace the essential absurdity of human existence. It asks us to come to terms with our own mortality and the seemingly arbitrary nature of the universe, which can be deeply unsettling.

But ultimately, I believe that the freedom and meaning that existentialism offers us is well worth the challenges that it presents. It is a philosophy that encourages us to fully embrace the messy, complex, and ultimately beautiful world that we inhabit. It is a philosophy that calls us to live fully and to create our own meaning and purpose in a world that can seem alienating and isolating at times.

Ari Aster: 
Existentialism is a philosophy that speaks to the very core of what it means to be human. It is about confronting the fact that we are alone in the world, facing the universe head-on, and carving out our own meaning and purpose in a seemingly indifferent world.

For me, this philosophy has been a driving force in my creative work as a filmmaker. My films, such as "Hereditary" and "Midsommar," are investigations into the nature of existence and the human psyche. They explore the ways in which our lives are shaped by our individual experiences and the choices we make in light of those experiences.

At the heart of existentialism is the recognition that we are free to create our own reality. We are not bound by the constraints of society or by religious dogma. We are free to construct our own sense of purpose, to discover our own values, and to make our own way in the world.

Of course, this freedom comes with a certain sense of responsibility. We must take responsibility for our own choices and accept the consequences that come with them. We must confront the fact that our lives are finite and that we will ultimately face our own mortality.

But it is precisely this confrontation with the fundamental realities of existence that makes existentialism so powerful. It is a philosophy that embraces life in all its raw, messy, and unpredictable glory. It demands that we look within ourselves, recognize our own limitations, and strive to live our lives to their fullest potential.

Ultimately, I believe that existentialism offers us a way to find meaning in a world that can sometimes seem meaningless. It is a way of embracing the beauty and complexity of the human experience, even in the face of its darkest aspects. And I hope that my work as a filmmaker can continue to explore and illuminate these themes for my audiences.

Kim Kardashian: 
Hey guys, I want to dive deeper into the idea of existentialism. I think that it is important to recognize that we are responsible for creating our own meaning in life. We can't rely on outside sources to give us a sense of purpose or fulfillment.

Some people might find this idea overwhelming, but for me, it is liberating. It means that I have the power to shape my own destiny and create the life that I want. I am not bound by societal expectations or the expectations of others.

I also believe that existentialism can help us deal with difficult situations. When we are faced with challenges or struggles, we can recognize that ultimately, it is up to us to find our own way forward. We can choose to embrace the challenges and find a way through them, rather than feeling like victims of circumstance.

Of course, this philosophy isn't for everyone. Some people might find it too pessimistic or overwhelming. But for me, it is a way to take ownership of my life and find a sense of purpose in a world that can sometimes seem chaotic or meaningless.

So, I'm curious to know what you guys think. Do you agree with the ideas of existentialism, or do you find it too overwhelming? And how do you think this philosophy can be applied to our everyday lives? Let's discuss!

Franz Kafka: 
The ideas behind existentialism are often viewed as pessimistic, but in reality, it is just a realistic perspective on life. It acknowledges the fundamental struggles and limitations that come with the human condition.

However, instead of shying away from life's struggles, existentialism encourages us to embrace them as part of our journey towards finding purpose and meaning. It allows us to take ownership of our lives and understand that our choices ultimately shape the trajectory of our existence.

But why has existentialism become such an important philosophy in modern times? In part, it is because it reflects the struggles and concerns of contemporary society. In a world where technology and social media have made us more connected than ever before, existentialism offers a way to cut through the noise and find deeper meaning in our lives.

This philosophy helps us recognize that while we may be inundated with information and distractions, ultimately, we are responsible for creating our own sense of purpose and fulfillment. It encourages us to take an active role in shaping our own destinies.

So, while existentialism may seem daunting at first, it ultimately offers a sense of freedom and agency in a world that can sometimes feel overwhelming. And I believe that more and more people are turning to this philosophy as a way to navigate the complexities of modern life.

Ari Aster: 
Existentialism is a philosophy that I find fascinating because it allows us to examine the human experience in a raw and honest way. It acknowledges that life can be difficult, complicated, and filled with uncertainty. And yet, it argues that we have the power to find meaning and purpose in our lives despite these difficulties.

I believe that this philosophy is especially relevant in today's world, where many people are struggling to find their place in society or to make sense of the world around them. According to a recent survey, over 60% of Americans report feeling lonely or isolated, and this feeling of disconnectedness can make it difficult to find purpose in life (Cigna, 2020).

But existentialism offers a way to reconnect with ourselves and the world by emphasizing that we have agency and control over our lives. We can choose to live our lives on our own terms and find meaning in our choices, even in the face of adversity. This can be incredibly empowering, and it's a message that many people need to hear.

Of course, not everyone will agree with these ideas. Some people may find existentialism too bleak or pessimistic. But I believe that this perspective is ultimately uplifting because it challenges us to take responsibility for our own lives and to create our own sense of purpose in the world.

So, I'm curious to hear what others think. How has the philosophy of existentialism impacted your life, or how do you see it influencing modern culture? Let's have a discussion!

Kim Kardashian: 
I think that existentialism is an incredibly important philosophy because it encourages us to take ownership of our lives and find meaning in our own experiences. As a public figure, I know how easy it is to get caught up in societal expectations and lose sight of our own individuality.

In fact, studies have shown that societal pressure can have a negative impact on mental health. According to the American Psychological Association, societal pressure can lead to feelings of anxiety, depression, and low self-esteem (APA, 2020). This is where the philosophy of existentialism comes in - it helps us recognize that we have the power to create our own sense of purpose and fulfillment, even in the face of societal pressure.

Of course, this philosophy is not without its challenges. It can be difficult to accept that we are ultimately responsible for our own experiences in life, and it can be overwhelming to confront the uncertainty and existential angst that comes with this perspective.

But I believe that this philosophy can also be incredibly liberating. By taking responsibility for our own lives, we can break free from the constraints of societal expectations and live our lives according to our own values and beliefs.

So, my question for you is this: how do you deal with societal pressure in your own life, and how has the philosophy of existentialism helped you in this regard? Let's keep the conversation going.

Franz Kafka: 
Existentialism is a philosophy that has been important to me throughout my life. It is a worldview that acknowledges the inherent difficulties and uncertainties of the human experience, while also emphasizing the importance of taking responsibility for our own lives and decisions.

One of the key tenets of existentialism is the idea that we are fundamentally alone in the world - that each individual is responsible for finding their own meaning and purpose in life. This can be a daunting proposition, but I believe it is also a liberating one. It means that we have the power to shape our own destinies, and that our lives are not beholden to any external forces or authorities.

Of course, this can be a difficult perspective to embrace. It can be tempting to look to external sources for guidance or direction. But I believe that existentialism emphasizes the importance of finding that direction within ourselves, rather than relying on others to provide it for us.

So my question for you is this: do you believe that we can truly find our own meaning and purpose in life? Or do you feel that this urge is ultimately futile in the face of the overwhelming complexity of human existence? Let's discuss.

Ari Aster: 
Existentialism is a philosophy that embraces the complexity and uncertainty of human existence. It recognizes that we are ultimately responsible for making our own meaning in life, and that this meaning is not handed to us by any external authority.

One of the key aspects of existentialism that resonates with me is the idea that we must confront the difficult aspects of life head-on. We can't simply shy away from our fears, uncertainties, and anxieties - we must face them head-on if we are to truly live a meaningful life.

Of course, this is not always an easy task. We live in a world that is often overwhelming, and it's easy to feel lost or disconnected at times. But I believe that existentialism offers us a way to navigate these difficulties and find a sense of purpose in our lives.

One way that we can do this is by focusing on our own individual experiences and perspectives. We each have a unique perspective on the world, and by taking ownership of this perspective, we can begin to see our place in the world more clearly.

Another way that we can embrace existentialism is by recognizing the importance of our own choices. We are all responsible for the decisions that we make, and these decisions ultimately shape the trajectory of our lives. By embracing this responsibility, we gain the power to shape our own destinies and find fulfillment in our own lives.

So my question for you is this: do you believe that existentialism offers a valuable perspective on life? And if so, how do you think we can apply its insights to our own lives? Let's keep the conversation going.

Kim Kardashian: 
I believe that existentialism is an important philosophy because it confronts us with the ultimate questions of human existence. By acknowledging our mortality, our isolation, and our limited control over the world around us, existentialism encourages us to live our lives more fully and with greater meaning.

At its core, existentialism is a philosophy of responsibility. It asks us to take responsibility for our own lives, for the choices that we make, and for the impact that we have on the world around us. By embracing this responsibility, we gain a greater sense of agency and control over our lives, and we can understand the purpose and significance of our own existence.

Of course, this is not always an easy path to follow. It can be difficult and even terrifying to confront the uncertainties and challenges of life. But I believe that by embracing the principles of existentialism, we can find true fulfillment and meaning in our lives.

So my question for you is this: have you ever felt lost or uncertain in your own life? And if so, have you ever turned to existentialism or other philosophical perspectives to find guidance or meaning? Let's keep the conversation going.

Franz Kafka: 
Existentialism is a philosophy that focuses on the individual as a unique and autonomous being who must create their own meaning in life. As an author who explored similar themes in my own work, I believe that existentialism is a valuable philosophy that can help us navigate the complexities of human existence.

Many people may feel lost or uncertain in their lives, and may look to external sources for guidance or direction. However, existentialism encourages us to look within ourselves and take responsibility for our own choices and actions. It is through this process of introspection and self-reflection that we can begin to find meaning and purpose in our own lives.

But this philosophy is not without its challenges. In fact, it can be quite daunting to face the inherent uncertainties and anxieties of human existence. But I believe that it is precisely by confronting these difficulties that we can truly grow and evolve as individuals.

So my question for you is this: do you believe that we can truly find meaning in our own lives, or is this an ultimately futile endeavor? And if you do believe that we can find meaning, what are some of the ways in which we can go about doing so? Let's continue the conversation.

Ari Aster: 
Existentialism is a philosophy that speaks to the core of our existence. It challenges us to take ownership of our lives, to find meaning in the face of uncertainty, and to take responsibility for our actions.

I believe that this philosophy is more relevant today than ever before. In a world that is increasingly complex and overwhelming, existentialism encourages us to confront the difficult aspects of life head-on, rather than shying away from them.

One of the key ways in which we can apply existentialism to our own lives is by taking control of our own narratives. By recognizing that we are ultimately responsible for constructing our own stories, we gain the power to shape our own destinies and find meaning in our own lives.

Another way in which existentialism can be applied is by embracing the present moment. Instead of constantly obsessing over the future or dwelling on the past, we can learn to become more present in each and every moment, and find meaning and purpose in our experiences.

At the end of the day, existentialism is a philosophy of action. It encourages us to take responsibility for our own lives, to confront the difficult questions of existence, and to find meaning in the face of uncertainty. And I believe that by embracing these principles, we can lead more fulfilling and meaningful lives.

Kim Kardashian: 
Sorry, it seems like you accidentally repeated the instructions again. Can you please provide me with a topic for me to discuss and share my thoughts on? I'd be happy to engage in a conversation with you.

Franz Kafka: 
As Franz Kafka, I would like to discuss the concept of existential anxiety. This is the feeling of unease and dread that arises when we confront the essential questions of life: what is my purpose? What happens after I die? Am I in control of my own fate?

Existential anxiety is a natural response to the uncertainties and complexities of human existence. It is the result of grappling with the daunting realities of our mortality and our place in the universe. But I also believe that, by embracing our anxieties and confronting them head-on, we can ultimately find a greater sense of purpose and meaning in our lives.

One of the key ways in which we can address our existential anxieties is by cultivating a sense of authenticity and personal responsibility. Instead of being passive victims of fate, we must take ownership of our lives and our choices, knowing that our actions have an impact on the world around us.

Another way in which we can deal with our anxieties is by embracing the importance of human relationships. By forming meaningful connections with others, we can find a sense of belonging and purpose that transcends our individual anxieties and concerns.

Of course, existential anxiety is not something that can be easily overcome. It is an ongoing journey of self-reflection and self-discovery. But I believe that by embracing the difficult questions of existence, we can ultimately find a greater sense of meaning and purpose in our lives.

Ari Aster: 
Existentialism is a philosophy that acknowledges the complexities of human existence, and encourages us to actively engage with these complexities in order to find meaning and purpose in our lives. It's a perspective that suggests that we are not simply passive observers of reality, but rather active participants in the creation of our own stories.

One of the key components of existentialism is the value placed on individual choice and responsibility. By recognizing the fact that our choices have consequences and impact the world around us, we can take ownership of our lives and begin to craft our own narratives.

Another important aspect of existentialism is the acknowledgement of impermanence and mortality. By accepting the finite nature of our existence, we are prompted to make the most of the time that we have, and to find ways to create value and meaning in our lives.

Ultimately, existentialism is a challenging philosophy that asks us to confront our deepest fears and anxieties. But it is also a deeply rewarding philosophy that can help us to find purpose and fulfillment in the face of life's uncertainties.

My question for you is this - how do you feel about the prospect of taking ownership of your own life and making your own choices? Do you find this idea empowering or daunting, and why?
